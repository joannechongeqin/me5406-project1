# ME5406 Deep Learning In Robotics - Project 1

## The Frozen Lake Problem and Variations

### Description

This project explores the Frozen Lake problem and its variations using deep learning techniques: 
- First-visit Monte Carlo Control without Exploring Starts
- SARSA with an $\epsilon$-greedy Behavior Policy
- Q-Learning with an $\epsilon$-greedy Behavior Policy

### How To Run
1. Create your own python environment 
2. Install dependencies
```
pip install -r environment.yml
```
3. Run ```main.ipynb```
